#TODO: How do I declare header once and re-use, to avoid repetition, like in my case below:
http:
  clients:

    plan-client:
      url: "${base-url}/plan"
      headers:
        Content-Type: "application/json"
        Authorization: "Bearer ${paystack-client.secret-key}"

    apple-pay-client:
      url: "${base-url}/apple-pay"
      headers:
        Content-Type: "application/json"
        Authorization: "Bearer ${paystack-client.secret-key}"

    transaction-client:
      url: "${base-url}/transaction"
      headers:
        Content-Type: "application/json"
        Authorization: "Bearer ${paystack-client.secret-key}"

    product-client:
      url: "${base-url}/product"
      headers:
        Content-Type: "application/json"
        Authorization: "Bearer ${paystack-client.secret-key}"
